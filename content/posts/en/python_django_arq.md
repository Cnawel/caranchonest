A senior Python developer is expected to have a deep understanding of Python programming, web development, and the ability to design and build complex web applications. They should possess the following skills and knowledge to create web apps:

1. **Flask or Django:** Proficiency in a Python web framework like Flask or Django is crucial. A senior developer should be able to choose the appropriate framework for a project and use it effectively to build web applications.

2. **Database Integration:** Expertise in working with databases is essential. This includes knowledge of SQL and experience with database systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or NoSQL databases such as MongoDB.

3. **API Development:** Creating and consuming APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) is a common task. Senior developers should understand RESTful API design principles and how to build APIs for their applications.

4. **Front-End Technologies:** Familiarity with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is necessary. Senior developers should be able to work with front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js when required.

5. **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing secure authentication and authorization systems is crucial. Knowledge of OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and role-based access control is essential for protecting web applications.

6. **Security Best Practices:** Senior Python developers should be well-versed in security best practices, including input validation, protecting against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF), and data encryption.

7. **Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing unit tests and practicing TDD is vital to ensure the reliability and maintainability of web applications.

8. **Containerization and Deployment:** Familiarity with containerization technologies like Docker and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes is valuable. Senior developers should know how to deploy web applications to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

9. **Scalability and Performance Optimization:** Understanding how to scale web applications horizontally and vertically and optimize performance through caching, load balancing, and database indexing is crucial for handling increased traffic.

10. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implementing CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI/CD for automated testing and deployment is essential for streamlining the development and deployment process.

**IN DETAIL**

Certainly, let's dive deeper into how to implement real-time updates, API endpoints, and data storage and processing using Django (back-end) and React.js (front-end) for an IoT dashboard.

**Front-End (User Interface) with React.js:**

1. **Real-Time Updates with WebSocket:**

   To achieve real-time updates in React.js, you can use the `socket.io-client` library to establish WebSocket connections with the server. Here's a snippet of how you can set up real-time updates:

   ```javascript
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
   import io from 'socket.io-client';

   const Dashboard = () => {
     const [sensorData, setSensorData] = useState([]);

     useEffect(() => {
       // Connect to the WebSocket server
       const socket = io('ws://your-server-address');

       // Listen for real-time updates
       socket.on('sensorDataUpdate', (data) => {
         setSensorData(data);
       });

       return () => {
         // Disconnect from the WebSocket when the component unmounts
         socket.disconnect();
       };
     }, []);

     return (
       <div>
         <h1>IoT Dashboard</h1>
         {/* Display real-time sensor data */}
         <ul>
           {sensorData.map((data) => (
             <li key={data.id}>{data.value}</li>
           ))}
         </ul>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default Dashboard;
   ```

   On the server-side, you would implement WebSocket handling using a library like `django channels`.

**Back-End (Server-Side) with Django:**

2. **API Endpoints:**

   In Django, you can create API endpoints using Django REST framework to receive data from IoT devices and serve data to the front-end. Here's an example of how to define an API endpoint for sensor data:

   ```python
   # api/views.py
   from rest_framework import viewsets
   from .models import SensorData
   from .serializers import SensorDataSerializer

   class SensorDataViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
       queryset = SensorData.objects.all()
       serializer_class = SensorDataSerializer
   ```

   ```python
   # api/urls.py
   from django.urls import path, include
   from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
   from . import views

   router = DefaultRouter()
   router.register(r'sensordata', views.SensorDataViewSet)

   urlpatterns = [
       path('', include(router.urls)),
   ]
   ```

   In this example, we create an API endpoint for the `SensorData` model.

3. **Data Storage and Processing:**

   To store historical sensor data and device information, you can use Django's built-in database models along with a database system like PostgreSQL or MongoDB. Here's a simplified model definition:

   ```python
   # api/models.py
   from django.db import models

   class SensorData(models.Model):
       timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
       value = models.FloatField()
       device = models.ForeignKey(Device, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

   class Device(models.Model):
       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       # Add more device-related fields as needed
   ```

   Django will take care of creating the database tables for these models. You can then use Django's ORM to store and query sensor data.

Remember to configure your Django project to use Django REST framework for building API endpoints and handle WebSocket connections for real-time updates. This is a high-level overview, and you'll need to tailor it to your specific IoT dashboard requirements.
