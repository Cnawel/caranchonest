 ### Book Review: Bug Bounty Bootcamp
 
!(/bug_bounty_bootcamp.png)

Bug Bounty Bootcamp by Vickie Li, published by No Starch Press, is a fantastic guide for anyone looking to dive into bug bounty programs! 🕷️🎯💻 This book stands out in the security space with its focused approach and easy-to-follow content. It covers a wide range of vulnerabilities while specifically catering to bug bounties, making it a must-have for aspiring hunters. 📘🔒

When I heard about this book, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it! 🤩 After all, it had received glowing recommendations from internet communities. After a month of anticipation, it finally arrived, and let me tell you, it didn't disappoint! 🚀 All opinions expressed in this review are my own, so you can trust that it's an authentic account.

Bug Bounty Bootcamp starts with an introduction to bug bounty programs, helping readers understand their role within a company's security framework. It also offers valuable insights on selecting the right bounties and managing different program scenarios. However, it's worth noting that the book might be a tad optimistic for newcomers, but that's okay because it sets the bar high for you to strive towards! 🌟🎯

The book then dives into foundational knowledge and tooling setup, along with conducting effective reconnaissance on the target environment. Although the reconnaissance section might seem brief given the vast array of approaches available, it serves as an excellent starting point, especially for beginners. As you progress and gain experience, you'll discover additional sources of information that can be integrated into your testing methodology, expanding your coverage and findings. 📈🔎

Next, Bug Bounty Bootcamp explores various vulnerability types commonly found in web applications. While it's impossible to cover every vulnerability comprehensively, the book does an impressive job of addressing the majority of findings encountered in real-world scenarios. With 16 chapters dedicated to different vulnerability classes, it's natural to feel overwhelmed initially. My advice is to start with a subset of classes, gradually expanding your focus as you become more comfortable with the testing process and tools. 🕷️📚💪

Chapter 17 deserves special mention, as it discusses logic errors and broken access control—a must-read not just for bug bounty hunters but also for web developers! These bugs are pervasive and challenging to mitigate with frameworks, web application firewalls, or automated tools, as they require a deep understanding of both business logic and vulnerability classes. 🐛🚫🔐

The book's final part, labeled "Expert Techniques," delves into advanced topics like API and Android application security, expanding beyond web security. APIs, in particular, are often HTTP-based interfaces with a user-friendly façade, making their exploration a natural extension of web security. Fuzzing, on the other hand, represents a more advanced concept, but the book provides a concise introduction to get you started. While these chapters may feel supplemental, they can greatly benefit newcomers to the security field once they've gained experience with other vulnerabilities and tools. 🚀🔒📱

Bug Bounty Bootcamp goes beyond technical aspects and covers automation, ongoing testing lifecycles, and custom scripting and development. This makes it a valuable resource not only for bug bounty enthusiasts but also for those aspiring to full-time security roles like penetration testers or application security engineers. For what I have read, It's worth noting that supplementing the book's teachings with additional resources, such as "The Web Application Hacker's Handbook," can provide a more well-rounded perspective (book review coming soon...). 🔄📚💡

In summary, Bug Bounty Bootcamp is an excellent resource for individuals eager to participate in bug bounty programs. It offers both technical knowledge and guidance in developing a robust testing methodology. Even if you're new to the security domain, the book explains vulnerability types from first principles, ensuring a smooth learning experience. The writing style is engaging and straightforward, making it an enjoyable read throughout. 📘🌟✨
